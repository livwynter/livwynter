	<p>“It’s the feeling you get when you’re walking from the bus stop to your house, and it’s 3am and you’re feeling waved and you see someone up ahead. You immediately start to think about what you look like, and whether it’ll be safer to try and pass as a boy or girl. Like one of those things is safer. And your train of thought is do I wanna be a girl? Does that person look like a rapist, or does he look like someone who wouldn’t hurt a woman? Do I wanna be a boy? Does he look like someone who wants to fight or mug me? Or if I put my hood up and head down and move a little lower in my trainers will he just walk past.

I guess it’s like code switching, it’s the train of thought that stems from always being spoken to at bus stops, or heckled at on the streets, it’s trying to work out how I can present myself in a way that’s gonna get the least amount of kickback. And to be honest it fucking sucks. We all know we should be able to look how we want, where we want, but we also all put our hoods up at the bus stop.

In my rap battle I thought about all those dickheads at bus stops and what I wanted to say to them. The satisfaction of saying ‘yo fuck you, fuck this attitude, fuck you if you wanna call me a dyke and say I’m ugly and fat: I honestly don’t care anymore. Calling me a dyke isn’t insulting, sorry, and I don’t care what you think about my body because it’s mine and its covered in scars and fucking badass tattoos and my lover loves it and so do I’.

Learning to say ‘fuck you’ is incredibly hard but it is one of the most liberating experiences. Ever. Unfortunately the reality of this is that some people don’t like being told fuck you. I’ve told men to fuck off before and felt the violent repercussions. I guess as queer people we’re always walking that line between saying ‘fuck you’ and keeping your hoods up.”<p>
